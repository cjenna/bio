      <h3>past</h3>
      <p>Raised in the Midwest, I grew up with a techy dad, but I always preferred language arts over computer languages.</p>
      <p>Sticking with my passion for prose and poetry, I graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University with a degree in literature. As you may suspect, writing beautiful essays is not the most sought after skill.</p>
	  <p>My job search landed me in Chicago where my communication skills built relationships with clients at Hewitt. When family drew me back south, I found a rewarding role as a psychology practice manager.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 text-center">
      <h3>present</h3>
      <p>Although mental health care is a fulfilling field and practice management provided me with a breadth of experience, I found the constraints of private practice limiting. So, when I learned State Farm had a department dedicated to innovating, that was all it took.<br>I was hooked.</p>
	  <p>I've been part of an innovation team since August 2015, and I cannot fathom ever working outside the realm of innovation. Every day, I get to investigate, ideate and create.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 text-right">  	
      <h3>future</h3>        
      <p>I've always believed innovation can elevate the plane on which our business intersects with consumers and communities. To help actualize that vision, I know I will need to keep learning and growing.</p>
	  <p>The goals I've set are simple. My development plan focuses on acquiring more human centered design experience as well as coding skills. I also realize I need to branch out and extend my network.</p>
      <p>Lucky for me, the Intro to Programming nanodegree at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000">Udacity.com</a> and the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/cjenna">freeCodeCamp.org</a> community tick all three boxes!</p>
